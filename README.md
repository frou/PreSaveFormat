This fork of the original repository has been heavily modified:

* It is no longer specific to Elm.
    * "Pre save" code formatting can now be done for any language using any CLI code formatter. These get configured in the settings file.
* The path inclusion/exclusion system for deciding whether to format the current file has gained the concept of shared defaults and extensions to those defaults.
